*** Steps to do limit setting ***

1. Prepare the nEventZH.txt (Save event numbers which scale to luminosity)

2. Change the MakeDataCards.py 
   2.1 change template card (bin/process/rate/CMS_XX)
   2.2 change nameinnumber and signalnameinnumber

3. run: python MakeDataCards.py nEventZH.txt .
   3.1 This will produce a lot of text files according to mass points.

4. cd /afs/cern.ch/work/h/htong/CMSSW_7_1_5/src/HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit/src

5. run: combine -M Asymptotic /afs/cern.ch/work/h/htong/xtozh_13TeV/makeDataCard/DataCard_MxxxxGeV_13TeV.txt
   5.1 This will produce one root file, rename it before run the next text file.
   5.2 Example of name: higgsCombinecounting_1000.Asymptotic.mH120.root
   5.3 Move those root files to /afs/cern.ch/work/h/htong/xtozh_13TeV/makeDataCard

6. Use the plot_Asymptotic.C
   6.1 Create a text file to save the cross section of each mass point. (xsec_ZHsig.txt)
   6.2 Change something in the plot_Asymptotic.C
       6.2.1 define nXm -> which is the number of mass points
       6.2.2 int Xmass[nXm] = {1000,...} 
       6.2.3 also can change the name of output plots, x-/y-range of the plot...
   6.3 run: root -q -b -l plot_Asymptotic.C++\(\"counting\"\)
   6.4 This will produce the limits plot (normal and log-scale)
